# 🔍 Task 1: Local Network Port Scan – Cyber Security Internship

## 🧠 Objective
To learn and demonstrate basic network reconnaissance skills by scanning the local network for live hosts and open ports using **Nmap**, and understanding the potential security exposure.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) – for performing a TCP SYN scan
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) *(Optional)* – for capturing and analyzing packets

---

## 🌐 Network Details
- **Local IP Range Scanned**: `192.168.1.0/24`
- **Scanning Method**: TCP SYN scan (`nmap -sS`)
- **Devices Found**: 3 live hosts

---

## 🔍 Scan Results

### ✅ Host: `192.168.1.1` (ZTE Router)
- **Open Ports**:
  - `53/tcp` – DNS
  - `80/tcp` – HTTP
  - `443/tcp` – HTTPS
- **Filtered Port**:
  - `23/tcp` – Telnet *(filtered, possible security concern)*

### ✅ Host: `192.168.1.3`  
- **All ports closed (reset)** – No open TCP ports found.

### ✅ Host: `192.168.1.5` (Likely Windows machine)
- **Open Ports**:
  - `135/tcp` – MSRPC
  - `139/tcp` – NetBIOS Session Service
  - `445/tcp` – Microsoft-DS (SMB file sharing)
  - `902/tcp` – ISS RealSecure
  - `912/tcp` – Apex Mesh
  - `2869/tcp` – ICSLAP (Internet Connection Sharing)

## 🔐 Security Risk Analysis

| IP Address   | Port | Service     | Risk Summary                                               | Recommendation                     |
|--------------|------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 192.168.1.1  | 23   | Telnet      | Insecure, unencrypted protocol (filtered)                 | Disable Telnet if not used         |
|              | 80   | HTTP        | Unencrypted traffic                                        | Use HTTPS instead                  |
|              | 53   | DNS         | DNS open to local access                                   | Acceptable in router context       |
| 192.168.1.5  | 135   | MSRPC       | Commonly targeted on Windows networks                      | Restrict access or firewall        |
|              | 139   | NetBIOS     | Vulnerable to SMB-related attacks                          | Disable NetBIOS if not needed      |
|              | 445   | SMB         | Exploitable via EternalBlue, WannaCry, etc.                | Block/disable or isolate network   |
|              | 902   | ISS         | Intrusion detection port, could reveal info to attacker    | Close unless specifically needed   |
|              | 2869  | ICSLAP      | UPnP-related service, often misused                        | Disable UPnP on LAN unless needed  |

## 📈 Steps Performed

1. Identified IP range using `ipconfig`.
2. Installed Nmap and ran scan:
   ```bash
   nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 -oX scan_result.xml
   ```
3. Parsed and analyzed the results using XML output.
4. Mapped services and performed security risk analysis.

## 📚 Key Learnings

- Learned how to use **Nmap** to discover live hosts and open ports.
- Understood how **services running on open ports** can present attack vectors.
- Learned how to interpret filtered, open, and closed port states.
- Understood basics of **LAN reconnaissance and port security**.
